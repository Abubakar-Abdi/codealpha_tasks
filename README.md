📈 Stock Market Forecasting Using LSTM

🌟 Introduction

Stock market forecasting is one of the most challenging and dynamic tasks in the field of data science. Traditional statistical models often fail to capture the complex, non-linear relationships in stock price movements. This project leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict stock prices with higher accuracy.

🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to forecast the stock prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using historical stock data and deep learning techniques. The model is trained on past stock price trends and learns patterns to make future predictions.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used for training is AAPL.csv, which contains historical stock price data for Apple Inc.

Key features include:

Open price

High price

Low price

Close price

Volume traded

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

Pandas & NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn

scikit-learn

🔍 Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Normalize stock prices for better model performance

Split dataset into training and testing sets

LSTM Model Implementation:

Build a multi-layered LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras

Train the model with historical stock data

Evaluate performance using loss metrics

Prediction & Visualization:

Use the trained model to predict stock prices

Compare predictions with actual stock prices

Visualize trends and performance metrics

📊 Results & Insights

The LSTM model effectively captures stock price trends and provides accurate short-term predictions.

Performance is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Insights on market volatility and price trends are extracted from model predictions.
